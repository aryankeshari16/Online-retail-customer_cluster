🛍️ Online Retail Customer Segmentation

Welcome to the Online Retail Customer Segmentation project! This initiative leverages machine learning techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behaviors, enabling businesses to tailor marketing strategies effectively.

📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer data from an online retail store to identify distinct customer segments. By understanding these segments, businesses can:

🎯 Target marketing campaigns more effectively

💡 Enhance customer retention strategies

📈 Increase overall profitability


🧰 Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python 🐍

Libraries & Frameworks:

Data Manipulation: pandas, numpy

Data Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

Machine Learning: scikit-learn

Web Framework: Flask


Modeling Techniques:

K-Means Clustering

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis

🔍 Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values

Removing duplicates

Feature engineering for RFM analysis



2. RFM Analysis:

Recency: Days since last purchase

Frequency: Number of purchases

Monetary: Total spend



3. Clustering:

Applying K-Means clustering to RFM features

Determining optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method



4. Model Deployment:

Building a Flask web application to input customer data and predict segments



📈 Results

The clustering analysis revealed distinct customer segments:

High-Value Customers: Frequent purchases with high monetary value

Mid-Value Customers: Moderate purchase frequency and spend

Low-Value Customers: Infrequent purchases with low spend


These insights can guide targeted marketing and customer engagement strategies.
